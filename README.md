# ArduinoBopIt
A fun little project I made to get familiar with the Arduino Esplora,
It is a game inspired by 'Bop it' where the player is given a series 
of commands to execute before the time runs out.

To Do:  
-Display Scores, Save High score, for current session.  
-Add a random confirmation word generator (good, awesome, great etc.)  
-Centre text  
-Make pretty border etc.  
-Make a start button
